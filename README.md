# Entropy-of-networks-and-Theta-indicator-single-networks-

This repository contains three matlab codes:

1) Entropy_Q.m calculates the entropy of randomized network ensembles with given assignment of features

2) Entropy_distance.m calculates the entropy of randomize network ensembles with given distance distribution

3) Theta.m calulates the Theta indicator of a given network with feature of the nodes
